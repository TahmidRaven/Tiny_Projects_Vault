# QR Code Generator
## This is a python script that creates a QR Code

It's a simple script; however, I plan on doing something more sophisticated with it later on. 

### Features:
1. user inputs have been provided for both the link and the naming of the image file
2. user can change the location where it can be saved
3. extension handeling is enabled

# Password Generator
## This is a python script that generates random passwords

It's a simple script; however, I plan on doing something more sophisticated with it later on. 

### Features:
* Has a cool ascii art that welcomes the user 
* Uses the art library to generate the ascii art
* Takes user input for password length

#### Intentions:
* Want to modify Where user would give a word that like to use in the password
* Better user experience by letting the user choose if their favorite numbers/ uniques characters they want to include in the password
* Might make additional changes to the current script
